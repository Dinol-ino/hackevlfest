# Emotion Aware Sentiment Analysis with FastAPI and Next.js

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application that performs **emotion-aware sentiment analysis** by combining **facial expression tracking** with **chat-based interactions**.  
It uses computer vision and fine-tuned NLP models to detect user emotions in real time and generate context-aware responses.

The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, while the frontend is built with **Next.js** and **React**. Hugging Face models are integrated for natural language understanding, and optional support for **Supabase** is included for storage and authentication.
